    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: April 23, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Hey there! Welcome to <em>Pioneer Farm</em>, a chill farming game made by the Mamang Gim. We’re all about keeping your info safe while you plant crops, water plants, and trade with <strong>Pi Coin</strong> through the <strong>Pi Network</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains what info we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it—nice and simple. It also covers deposits and withdrawals with Pi Coin.</p>
    <p>By playing <em>Pioneer Farm</em>, you’re cool with this policy. If not, no worries, but you might wanna skip the game. Give it a quick read to know what’s up!</p>

    <h2>1. Info We Collect</h2>
    <p>We grab some info to keep the game running and fun. Here’s the deal:</p>
    <h3>a. Stuff You Share</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Details</strong>: Username, email, or Pi Network invite code when you sign up.</li>
      <li><strong>Pi Coin Stuff</strong>: Your Pi Network wallet address for deposits or withdrawals. You’ll also do <strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong> through Pi Network, which might ask for your name, ID, or a selfie.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Picks</strong>: Crops you plant, inventory items, or settings (like language or music volume).</li>
      <li><strong>Support Chats</strong>: If you hit us up about a bug (like empty notifications), you might share your email or name.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>b. Stuff We Pick Up</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tech Info</strong>: Device type, operating system, IP address, or device ID, plus network details.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Actions</strong>: How long you play, your level, coins/water, or moves like planting, watering, or harvesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Data</strong>: We use <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> to store game stuff (like inventory or language settings). Firebase also tracks basic analytics, like how often you play.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (Optional)</strong>: If you’re okay with it, we might grab your general location (like country) for analytics, but you can say no.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>c. Pi Network Info</h3>
    <p>Pi Network handles KYC and wallet checks for Pi Coin transactions. We just get a “pass/fail” on KYC (no ID or selfie details) and your wallet address.</p>
    <h3>d. Third-Party Info</h3>
    <p>If you log in with Google (for Firebase Authentication), we might get your email or name. Firebase Analytics helps us see how players use the game (like how many crops get planted).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Info</h2>
    <p>We use your info to make <em>Pioneer Farm</em> awesome and smooth. Here’s what we do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Run the Game</strong>: Save your progress (inventory, crops) and show notifications like “Planted!” or “Watered!”. Handle Pi Coin deposits and withdrawals via Pi Network.</li>
      <li><strong>Level It Up</strong>: Check how you play to tweak features, like growing animations, <code>plant-fly</code>, <code>water-fly</code>, or <code>.sparkle</code> effects. Set your language (from <code>lang.json</code>) or other preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep It Safe</strong>: Use Pi Network’s KYC to make sure you’re you and prevent fraud. Catch weird stuff like bots or cheating.</li>
      <li><strong>Help You</strong>: Fix issues you report (like blank notifications).</li>
      <li><strong>Learn What’s Cool</strong>: Look at anonymous data to see what players dig, like shop usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Send Updates (Optional)</strong>: Email you about new crops or events, but only if you want. Unsubscribe anytime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Who We Share Info With</h2>
    <p>We don’t sell your info, ever. We only share when it’s needed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Our Helpers</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong>: Stores game data and tracks analytics. They’ve got tight privacy rules (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Pi Network</strong>: Runs KYC and Pi Coin transactions. Your KYC stays with them (<a href="https://socialchain.app/privacy" target="_blank">Pi Network’s Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>If We Have To</strong>: We’ll share info if the law asks, like for fraud checks.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Features</strong>: For stuff like leaderboards, your username might show (but nothing private).</li>
      <li><strong>Business Stuff</strong>: If <em>Pioneer Farm</em> gets sold, your info might go to the new owner, but we’ll keep it safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Storing and Protecting Your Info</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Where It’s Kept</strong>: Game data is in <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> on Google Cloud (probably in <code>asia-southeast1</code> for our region). KYC data is with Pi Network, not us.</li>
      <li><strong>How Long</strong>: We keep your account and progress while you play. Pi Coin transaction records stick around for a few years (financial rules). Analytics data is anonymous and kept indefinitely.</li>
      <li><strong>Keeping It Safe</strong>: We use encryption (HTTPS) for data transfers. Firebase rules lock down data to authorized users. Your Pi Coin wallet is secured by Pi Network; we just hold the address, not your keys. We check for hacks and update our systems regularly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Options</h2>
    <p>You’re in charge of your info. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check or Fix</strong>: Ask to see your data or correct mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Tell us to wipe your account (we might keep transaction records for legal reasons).</li>
      <li><strong>Skip Emails</strong>: Don’t want updates? Hit “unsubscribe” or let us know.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Analytics</strong>: Block Firebase Analytics in your device settings (might affect gameplay).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Email us at <a href="mailto:mamanggim@gmail.com">mamanggim@gmail.com</a>, and we’ll reply in a few days.</p>

    <h2>6. Pi Coin Transactions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposits & Withdrawals</strong>: Use your Pi Network wallet to add or pull Pi Coin after KYC. Transactions run on Pi Network’s blockchain, so they might take a sec if it’s busy. We don’t charge fees, but Pi Network or exchanges might.</li>
      <li><strong>Heads-Up</strong>: Pi Coin’s price can jump or crash. We can’t cover losses if it tanks. Mess up your wallet address? Coins could get lost, so double-check! KYC issues or locked Pi accounts might block transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Kids and the Game</h2>
    <p><em>Pioneer Farm</em> is for players 13+. We don’t collect info from kids under 13. If we spot kid’s data, we delete it fast. Parents can email <a href="mailto:mamanggim@gmail.com">mamanggim@gmail.com</a> to remove their kid’s info.</p>

    <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We use <strong>cookies</strong> and stuff like localStorage to: Save your settings (language, volume). Keep your game session active. Track analytics (via Firebase) to improve the game.</li>
      <li>Block cookies in your browser if you want, but it might break progress saving.</li>
      <li>No third-party ad cookies here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We might tweak this policy for new features or feedback. We’ll ping you via email, in-game notices, or our site [www.pioneerfarm.com, if exists] a week before changes go live. Keep playing, and you’re good with the updates.</p>
