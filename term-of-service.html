    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: April 23, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to <em>My Harvest Farm</em>, a fun farming game brought to you by the Mamang Gim! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are the rules for playing our game and using our services, including deposits and withdrawals with <strong>Pi Coin</strong> through the <strong>Pi Network</strong>. By playing <em>My Harvest Farm</em> or using any of our features, you agree to follow these Terms. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the game. Take a quick read to know how things work!</p>

    <h2>1. Who Can Play</h2>
    <p><em>My Harvest Farm</em> is for players aged 13 and up. If you’re under 13, sorry, but you can’t play. If you’re under 18, make sure your parent or guardian is cool with you playing and handling Pi Coin transactions.</p>
    <p>You need a valid Pi Network account with completed <strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong> verification to use deposit or withdrawal features. It’s your job to keep your account secure and not share your login or Pi Network wallet details with anyone.</p>

    <h2>2. How to Play Fair</h2>
    <p>We want everyone to have fun, so please play by these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be Nice</strong>: Don’t cheat, hack, use bots, or exploit bugs (like spamming the shop). Don’t harass other players or post harmful stuff if we add social features.</li>
      <li><strong>One Account</strong>: Only use one account per person. Multiple accounts to game the system (like extra coins or Pi Coin rewards) will get you banned.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow the Law</strong>: Don’t use the game for anything illegal, like fraud or money laundering.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect the Game</strong>: Don’t try to reverse-engineer, copy, or mess with our code, animations (like <code>plant-fly</code> or <code>water-fly</code>), or assets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you break these rules, we might suspend or ban your account, and you could lose access to your coins, inventory, or Pi Coin balance. No refunds for banned accounts.</p>

    <h2>3. Pi Coin Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
    <p>You can deposit or withdraw <strong>Pi Coin</strong> using your Pi Network wallet, but here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>KYC Required</strong>: You must pass Pi Network’s KYC (name, ID, selfie) to deposit or withdraw. We don’t handle KYC—that’s all Pi Network.</li>
      <li><strong>Your Responsibility</strong>: Double-check your wallet address before depositing or withdrawing. If you send Pi Coin to the wrong address, we can’t get it back.</li>
      <li><strong>Price Swings</strong>: Pi Coin’s value can go up or down. We’re not responsible if you lose money due to price changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Fees</strong>: We don’t charge fees for transactions, but Pi Network or exchanges might. Check with them.</li>
      <li><strong>Delays</strong>: Transactions run on Pi Network’s blockchain, so they might take time if the network’s busy.</li>
      <li><strong>Limits</strong>: We may set limits on deposits or withdrawals (like max 100 Pi Coin per day) to keep things fair. We’ll let you know in-game if there are limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your Pi Network account gets locked or KYC fails, you won’t be able to deposit or withdraw. Contact Pi Network for help with that.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Game Account</h2>
    <p>Your account is yours alone, and you’re responsible for it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your login details (and Pi Network wallet) safe. If someone else uses your account, you’re still responsible for what they do.</li>
      <li>You can’t sell, trade, or give your account to anyone else.</li>
      <li>We use <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> to store your game data (like inventory, coins, or transaction history). If you delete your account, we’ll wipe your data, but some transaction records might stay for legal reasons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to delete your account, email us at <a href="mailto:mamanggim@gmail.com">mamanggim@gmail.com</a>. Note that deleted accounts can’t be restored, and any Pi Coin balance might be lost if not withdrawn first.</p>

    <h2>5. Game Content and Ownership</h2>
    <p>All the cool stuff in <em>My Harvest Farm</em>—like animations (<code>plant-fly</code>, <code>water-fly</code>, <code>.sparkle</code>), music, and art—belongs to the Mamang Gim or our partners. You get to enjoy it while playing, but you can’t copy, sell, or use it outside the game.</p>
    <p>Any content you create (like usernames or future social posts) must follow our rules (no offensive stuff). We can use your username or game actions (like leaderboard rankings) to promote the game, but we won’t share your personal info.</p>

    <h2>6. Payments and Refunds</h2>
    <p>Deposits with Pi Coin are final—no refunds unless we mess up (like a bug double-charging you). If you think there’s an error, email us at <a href="mailto:mamanggim@gmail.com">mamanggim@gmail.com</a> within 7 days, and we’ll check it out.</p>
    <p>If we shut down the game (hope not!), we’ll give you at least 30 days’ notice to withdraw your Pi Coin. After that, any remaining balance might be forfeited.</p>

    <h2>7. Our Responsibilities (and Limits)</h2>
    <p>We work hard to keep <em>My Harvest Farm</em> fun and safe, but here’s the deal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bugs Happen</strong>: The game might have glitches (like blank notifications). We’ll fix them ASAP, but we’re not responsible for losses (like missing coins) caused by bugs.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Availability</strong>: We might update, pause, or shut down the game for maintenance or other reasons. We’ll try to let you know first.</li>
      <li><strong>Pi Coin Risks</strong>: We don’t control Pi Network’s blockchain or Pi Coin’s price. If you lose money due to network issues or price drops, that’s not on us.</li>
      <li><strong>Your Device</strong>: Make sure your phone or computer meets the game’s needs (like a modern browser). We’re not responsible for crashes caused by your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re not liable for any indirect losses (like lost profits from Pi Coin trading) or damages beyond what you paid into the game (if anything).</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We might update these Terms if we add new features (like a leaderboard) or based on feedback. We’ll notify you via email, in-game messages, or our website [www.myharvestfarm.com, if exists] at least 7 days before changes take effect. If you keep playing, you agree to the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Got questions, issues, or wanna delete your account? Reach out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email</strong>: <a href="mailto:mamanggim@gmail.com">mamanggim@gmail.com</a></li>
